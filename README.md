# xkcd-comics
XKCD is a popular geek webcomic with a website full of interesting comics. The front page at http://xkcd.com/ has 'prev' and 'next' buttons that guide the user back and forth through the comics. Downloading each comic manually would take forever, but with this script it's just a matter of seconds ( depending on your internet speed ).
